## Background
Let's take a look at some examples of "not so good" repos:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- The one with a haphazard structure: Making a head or tail of such repos can be extremely frustrating. An organised repo can make it easy for the user to comprehend.
- The one with no Readme file: From the perspective of an external user, all the information required to accurately run the code should always be included.
- The one with cluttered code: A clean code can go a long way. Adding comments and instructions improves readability and reduces maintenance efforts.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
You can verify the version of python using this: 

```bash
python --version
```
